FOSSummMIT 2014
===================

This repository holds IPython Notebooks, I had planned to show & demo at FOSSummMIT 2014. For some non-issues, I won't be speaking at the event. More details at my [blog][1]

TODO:

1. Add comments to code, which otherwise I would have spoken
2. Complete one last code analysis of Airline Data
3. Put in sequence the IPython notebooks
4. Add relevant commentary in this README
